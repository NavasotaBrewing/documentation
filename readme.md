# Navasota Brewing Company

This is the entry point for all the software documentation belonging to the Navasota Brewing Company (NBC). All software is maintained under the `NavasotaBrewing` github account.

## What is NBC?
The Navasota Brewing Company is a brewery based in Navasota, Texas. It was started by David Sweeney, a long time homebrewer.

## The Brewery Control System
As we scale up NBC, we need greater control and automation over the brewing hardware. The software packages here, the "brewery control system" or "BCS", are our best effort to do just that.

There are several software packages under the `NavasotaBrewing` account that make up the BCS. Each package contains its own specific documentation.

### Versioning
Each package has it's own version, and versions will not line up between packages. The releases within this repository will be "BCS releases", which are soft releases specifying which versions of each of the packages are meant be to used together.

Each release of this repository will only have instructions on how to set up each release of the other packages.

# Navasota Brewing Company

This is the entry point for all the software documentation belonging to the Navasota Brewing Company (NBC). All software is maintained under the `NavasotaBrewing` github account.

## What is NBC?
The Navasota Brewing Company is a brewery based in Navasota, Texas. It was started by David Sweeney, a long time homebrewer.

## About the software
As we scale up NBC, we need greater control and automation over the brewing hardware. The software packages, the "brewery control system" or "BCS", here are our best effort to do just that.

There are several software packages under the `NavasotaBrewing` account. Each package contains its own specific documentation.

# Navasota Brewing Company

The [Navasota Brewing Company](https://navasotabrewing.com) is a brewery based in Navasota, Texas. It was started by David Sweeney, a long time homebrewer.

This is the entry point for all the software documentation belonging to the Navasota Brewing Company (NBC). All software is maintained under the `NavasotaBrewing` github account.

## The Brewery Control System
As we scale up NBC, we need greater control and automation over the brewing hardware. The software packages here, the "brewery control system" or "BCS", are our best effort to do just that.

There are several software packages under the `NavasotaBrewing` account that make up the BCS. Each package contains its own specific documentation.

### Architecture
See the [architecture page](architecture.md) for information about the layout of this project.

### Hardware
See the [hardware](hardware/readme.md) pages for information about the hardware we use.

## Versioning and Releases
Each package in the BCS ecosystem has it's own version number, and version numbers don't line up. Certain versions of each package are meant to be used together.

The [Github releases](https://github.com/NavasotaBrewing/readme/releases/) within this repository will have "BCS releases", which are soft releases specifying which versions of each of the packages are meant be to used together, as well as instructions on setting everything up.

Each repository will have documentation specific to that package. This one just holds information about the system as a whole and it's usage.

### Latest Release

See the [releases page](https://github.com/NavasotaBrewing/readme/releases/) for the latest release.

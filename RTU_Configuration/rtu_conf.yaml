# The RTUs Name
# This can be any string
# Constraints:
#   * Must not be empty
name: Testing RTU

# The RTUs id
# I would recommend the "slug" version of the RTU name.
# Constraints:
#   * Must be unique among all RTUs
#   * Must not contain whitespace
#   * Must not be empty
id: testing-rtu

# The RTUs IPv4 address
# RTUs should be configured with a static IP (without DHCP)
# Constraints:
#   * Must not be empty
ip_addr: 0.0.0.0

# The devices list
# technically this can be empty but then the RTU is not useful
# Constraints:
#   * Must be a list
devices:

  # Device ID
  # Constraints:
  #   * Must be unique among all devices *and* all RTUs, ie. not device
  #     in the system can have the same ID
  #   * Must not contain whitespace
  #   * Must not be empty

    # Device Port
    # Constraints:
    #   * Must be a valid and existing serial port on the RTU
    #   * Must not be empty

    # Device Address
    # This is the address of the specific device on the controller,
    # not the controller address. For example, if a relay board has 16 relays,
    # this specifies which relay this device sits on.
    # Constraints:
    #   * Must not be empty (even if not used, leave as 0)
    #   * Must be a parsable u8 (0-255)
    addr: 0

    # Controller address
    # This is the RS-485/Modbus address that the device runs on.
    # Constraints:
    #   * Must not be empty
    #   * Must be a parsable u8 (0-255)
    controller_addr: 22

    # The Controller type
    # This is the type of controller that the device runs on.
    # Constraints:
    #   * Must not be empty
    #   * Must *exactly* match a Controller variant provided by `brewdrivers`
    # Values (there may be more): CN7500 | STR1 | Waveshare
    # See here for full list: https://docs.rs/brewdrivers/latest/brewdrivers/controllers/enum.Controller.html
    controller: CN7500

    # The devices baudrate
    # This must be whatever the controller is configured to
    # Each controller sets their baudrate differently
    # Constraints:
    #   * Must not be empty
    #   * Must be a baudrate that the device supports
    baudrate: 19200

    # The device timeout in ms
    # This will increase the speed at which data is read from the device
    # If you set it too low, communication will fail.
    # I recommend at least 45.
    # Constraints:
    #   * Must not be empty
    #   * Must not be below 16ms
    timeout: 50

  # This is another device without the comments for brevity
